The code for SpliNet is adapted from
https://github.com/dros1986/neural_spline_enhancement.

There is no license declared, so by using this code we are in violation of
Copyright law. However, since the code accompanies a paper, we can assume it was
published to enable reproducibility of the study and therefore an academic usage
such as our project would be okay. As long as we don't publish our code or
results, there won't be any issue as there will be no plaintiff, no judge.
